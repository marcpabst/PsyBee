// This module defines the color types used in the psybee crate. It also
// defines some predefined colors that can be used in experiments.
//
// Accurate handling of colour in psybee experiments is a complex
// topic. This module provides a number of tools to help you with this.
//
// # Background
//
// You might be surprised to learn that there is no such thing as a simple
// RGB color in `psybee`. The reason for this is that many different
// colour spaces exist that can be represented as RGB. And since there is
// simply no way to know what RGB values mean without knowing the colour space,
// `psybee` requires you to specify the colour space when creating a
// color. This removes ambiguity and ensures that you always know what you
// are doing.
//
// ## Color spaces
//
// A color space is a mathematical model that describes how colors can be
// represented as tuples of numbers. Since human vision is trichromatic (i.e.
// we have three types of color receptors in our eyes), most color spaces
// are tristimulus color spaces. This means that all colors can be represented
// as a combination of three numbers.
//
// ### CIE XYZ colour space
//
// ...
//
// ### RGB colour spaces
//
// Many of the color spaces commonly used today in computer graphics
// are RGB color spaces. This means that the three numbers represent the amount
// of red, green, and blue light that is required to create a color. RGB colour
// spaces are defined by the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) and
// the white point. The white point is the color of a perfectly white surface
// under a given illumination, i.e. when all three primary colors are present
// in equal amounts. The most commonly used white point is the CIE standard
// illuminant D65, which is characterized by a color temperature of
// approximately 6500 K (wich apparently is the colour of daylight in
// western/central Europe).
//
// ### The electro-optical transfer function (EOTF)
//
// The electro-optical transfer function (EOTF) is a function that describes
// how the RGB values are converted to light intensity. In other words, it
// describes how the RGB values are converted to actual number of photons
// emitted by the display. In the simplest case, the EOTF is a linear function
// that simply scales the RGB values by a constant factor. However, most
// displays use a non-linear EOTF. This is mostly for historical reasons as
// CRT displays used a non-linear EOTF to compensate for the non-linear
// response of the phosphors used in the monitors. But as it turns out, the
// most commonly used EOTF today also happens to match the non-linear response
// of the human visual system reasonably well, allowing for more efficient
// encoding of the color values (more values are assigned to darker colors,
// which is where the human visual system is most sensitive). The most commonly
// used EOTF today is the sRGB transfer function, which is defined as follows:
//
// ```text
// if c <= 0.0031308
//    c * 12.92
// else
//   1.055 * c^(1.0 / 2.4) - 0.055
// ```
// where `c` is the RGB in the range [0.0, 1.0].
//
//
// # Colours in `psybee`
//
// ## Color types
//
// All colour handling in `psybee` is based on the `palette` crate
// (and this is also where new color spaces should be added). The `palette`
// crate is a very powerful crate for handling colors and color spaces. It
// provides a number of color spaces and conversion functions between them.
//
// `psybee` defines a number of color types that are based on the
// `palette` crate. These types are:
//  * `SRGBA`: An RGBA color in the sRGB color space with 32 bits of floating
//   point precision per channel.
// * `LinearSRGBA`: An RGBA color in the linear sRGB color space with 32 bits
//  of floating point precision per channel.
// * `XYZA`: An XYZA color with 32 bits of floating point precision per channel.
// * `YxyA`: A YxyA color with 32 bits of floating point precision per channel.
// * `DisplayP3RGB`: An RGBA color in the Display P3 color space with 32 bits
// of floating point precision per channel.
//
// ## Specifying colours
//
// As discussed above, `psybee` requires you to specify the color space
// when creating a color. This is done by using the appropriate color type.
// For example, if you would like to create a 50% gray color in sRGB, you can
// do so as follows:
// ```
// let grey = SRGBA::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
// ```
//
// Note that this is not (!) the same as the following:
//
// ```
// let grey = LinearSRGBA::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
// ```
//
// The first example creates a 50% gray color in sRGB color space. The
// second example creates a 50% gray color in linear sRGB color space.
// The difference between these two color spaces is that the sRGB color space
// uses a non-linear transfer function to encode the color values. In fact,
// 50% gray in the (non-linear) sRGB color space is the same as approximately
// 21% gray in the linear sRGB color space.
//
// ## Converting between color spaces
//
// The `palette` crate provides the `IntoColor` trait that allows you to
// convert between color spaces. For example, if you would like to convert
// the 50% gray color in sRGB to the linear sRGB color space, you can do so
// as follows:
// ```
// let grey = SRGBA::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0);
// let grey_linear = grey.into_color::<LinearSRGBA>();
// ```
//
// **Note:** Converting between color spaces is not lossless. This means that
// converting a color from one color space to another and back will not
// necessarily give you the same color.

/// temperature of approximately 6500 K[1].

/// The transfer function of sRGB is non-linear and piecewise linear,
